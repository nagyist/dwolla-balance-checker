dwolla-balance-checker
======================

A simple OS X Cocoa status bar app that lets you keep an eye on your Dwolla account balance.

How to Build
============

Open up the XCode project file "Dwolla Balance Checker.xcodeproj" with XCode 4.  Click the run button (or hit control+r) to build and run the app.

Usage
=====

Initially, you'll see "No token set" in the status bar.  Click on it and select Preferences from the drop down menu that appears.  From there, you'll need to set your Dwolla account's OAuth token.

You can generate an OAuth token here: https://developers.dwolla.com/dev/token

Click save and then select Refresh from the drop down to see your balance!
